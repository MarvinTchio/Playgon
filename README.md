# Playgon Anti-Social With Flow

Playgon Anti-Social Flow is Playgon FLow's social network. The Anti-scoial Flow's are usually grapically designed results
of game winners and Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs) from players within the ecosystem.

## Playgon Flow

Playgon Flow is an Open Source, decentralized, skilled and  fair based game engagement ecosystem where the player with the best Flow wins most of the crypto stake.\
Players recieve 100% of jackPot and contributors keeping this project secured and updated for the economy of gamers will fully benefit from exchange rates.

### `Features`

Exchange currency in app's wallet.\
Enable users to schedule live tournaments.\
Provide fair and instant smart payments.\
Enable users to post, comment, like or share each other's NFTs or game outcome.

### `To do`

Add smart contract to Metamask wallet and For sale page.\
Add tournament game graphics to scheduled events\
Develop and test Flow page to enable palyers to schedule and 
see the tier and group type of tournament.\
For Example a group of 3 tournamet on a game like Call of duty 
would be a tier 6 on Apex it would be an 8.\
The tier established will be analized and updated to give users
a better understanding of the skills required
to win jackpots from scheduled events.




### `Test`

Once the framework branch is good enough to get pushed to dev or Master 
,one can start developing test for our openSource application. For now, 
I'm thinking a few groovy and selenium tests. Once the application's MVP
is met Load, Performance and other tests will be developed.

### `Scalability`

**Note: The application should work on consoles and PC primarily and will be scaled with kubernetes initially**
